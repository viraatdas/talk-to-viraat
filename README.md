# Talk to Viraat

A chat interface for a fine-tuned GPT model trained on Viraat's iMessage conversations.


## Fine-tuning Context

This project uses a GPT model fine-tuned on iMessage data using the approach from the [GPT OSS cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/fine-tune-transfomers) 

The preprocessing script (`preprocess.py`) converts iMessage HTML exports into the proper format for fine-tuning.
